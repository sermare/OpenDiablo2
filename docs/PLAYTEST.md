# Act 1 playthrough log

Branch `feat/act1-playthrough`. The first hour of Act 1 is played by `OD2_AUTOSCRIPT`:

| Scenario | What it plays |
|---|---|
| `scripts/verify.d/9b-act1-playthrough.sh` | a brand new Sorceress (made by `OD2_AUTONEWCHAR`): Akara (intro, Den of Evil quest, topic), the gate to Blood Moor, fights and loot, the Den of Evil cave, clear it, back to Akara for the skill point, exit (saves the `.d2s`) |
| `scripts/verify.d/9c-act1-reload.sh` | loads the `.d2s` of 9b again: same hero, quests, waypoints; Akara has nothing more to say about the Den of Evil |
| `scripts/verify.d/9d-act1-sample-hero.sh` | the level 94 sample hero (a revived copy: the sample is a dead hardcore character, see `scripts/d2s-revive.go`) walks town, Blood Moor, Den, back |

By hand (the game needs a GUI session, see `docs/macos-quickstart.md`):

```sh
OD2_REALMAPS=1 OD2_AUTOSPEED=3 OD2_AUTOGAME=hero.d2s OD2_AUTOEXIT=1 \
  OD2_AUTOSCRIPT='wait:1;walkto:exit=2;expect:level=2;walkto:exit=8;expect:level=8;kill:all,200;exit' ./od2
```

New script steps (`d2game/d2autoscript`): `walkto:exit=<level>` (a border or an exit tile that leads there;
the hero fights what attacks him on the way), `walkto:object=<name>`, `kill:all[,<s>]` /
`kill:near=<tiles>[,<s>]` (melee, casts the best attack spell, drinks healing potions, retries monsters he
could not reach), `loot:<tiles>[,<s>]` (walks to the items, stores them), `until:<log substring>,<s>`
(only sees lines logged since the last step that did something), `menu:<NPC menu row or topic>`.
`OD2_AUTOSPEED=1..4` runs the game clock faster so the hour fits a verify run; `OD2_NOPOPULATE=1`
leaves the levels without natural monsters.

## What the level change is now

Walking out of a level is the real exit: the border between two Act 1 outdoor levels (the world layout of
`drlgworld` places their rectangles; the hero crosses the shared edge and arrives at the same world
position, `d2common/d2level/edges.go`) or the exit tile of a preset (cave entrance, stairs;
`TileDestination`). The town is the preset the world layout chose (TownN1/E1/S1/W1) in a map of its own.

## Bugs found by playing, and their fixes

| # | What a player saw | Root cause | Fix | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The gate of the Rogue Encampment leads nowhere; walking to the edge of Blood Moor does nothing | no code changed the level at a seamless outdoor border; with `OD2_REALMAPS=1` the town was still the old overworld with a fake wilderness | `d2level.EdgeExit/EdgeArrival` (+tests), `MapEngine.World`, `generateRealTown` (preset by `TownFile`), `advanceEdges` | a9833485 |
| 2 | `LEVEL 1:` logged while standing in Blood Moor after `OD2_AUTOLEVEL=2` | the client reported the Rogue Encampment as its level at start | `d2client.AddPlayer` uses the start level | a9833485 |
| 3 | Entering the Den of Evil did not move the Den quest (only scripted runs did) | the quest system only learned of area changes from `OD2_AUTOQUEST` | `afterLevelBuilt` calls `questArea` for every level change | a9833485 |
| 4 | After Talk the NPC menu pops up again at once (and the greeting plays again); the Talk submenu with the quest topic closes the moment it opens | `onNPCMenuChoice` kept `npcTarget` and closed the topic menu that `questTalk` had just opened | Talk closes the menu first and forgets the NPC unless a topic menu is open | a9833485 |
| 5 | The hero gives up on a far stair, item or chest after 12 s although he is walking | the time-out counted seconds, not progress | the give-up clock restarts when the hero gets closer (`walkProgressStep`, `groundState.progress`, test) | 7d0c4d08, fd00fa43 |
| 6 | The cave entrance of Blood Moor is not an exit (two preset variants carry style 5 and 6); the tile styles of caves, crypts and jail are not the LvlWarp ids | `Destination(level, style)` assumed style == LvlWarp id | cave entrance presets are resolved by their path (`CaveEntranceDestination`, `SetWarpDestination`); dungeon tiles by the observed style rule (`TileDestination`, tests with the styles of levels 8..35) | 13ff15f5, fd00fa43 |
| 7 | Blood Moor, the other wilderness levels and the Den have no monsters | outdoor DS1 presets carry no monster markers; `PopulateRoom` was never called | `populateLevel` fills blocks of 16x16 tiles from the Levels.txt list (`mon1..`, density), not on top of the arrival; monsters the hero cannot walk to are removed (`MapEngine.CanWalkTo`) so a level can be cleared | a9833485, fd00fa43 |
| 8 | Monster gold drops are an item called `gld` that lands in the inventory grid | `Director.dropLoot` used `DropItems`, which turns gold into an item | `DropLoot` + `NewGoldPile` | 13ff15f5 |
| 9 | Experience grows (606 of 500) but the hero never reaches level 2; the Den reward skill point is the only one | nothing promoted the hero: only the `levelup` console command | `advanceHeroLevel` (`levelsGained`, tested): level, skill and stat points, full life and mana, sound, save | fd00fa43 |
| 10 | A new character has no potions or scrolls, so a Den fight at 40 life is lost | the lobby's character has no items and the import left it so | `StartingContainers` from CharStats.txt for a hero that was never played (`freshHero`, tests) | 13ff15f5, fd00fa43 |
| 11 | A hero who dies in the Den respawns **in the Den map** at the town coordinates, and the next level change fails to load `SODDstf.COF` | the death system assumed the town map was loaded; the level change set the animation of a dead hero | `respawnLevel` builds the town of the act, the hero stands up first, the corpse waits in the level where it lies and is placed when that level is built again | 13ff15f5, fd00fa43 |
| 12 | The sample hero (level 94) dies at once | the sample `.d2s` is a dead hardcore character with 0 life | `scripts/d2s-revive.go` makes a living copy for the playtest | 78ea6d51 |
| 13 | After a level change the new level is shown from where the old hero stood (the camera glides), and Akara's speech banner stays on screen in Blood Moor | the camera only eases towards the hero; the speech bubble is not tied to the level | `snapCamera`, `SpeechBubble.Clear` in `afterLevelBuilt` | 78ea6d51 |
| 14 | The scripted hero ignored the zombie biting him while he chased a far monster, gave up on a monster he was hitting, and chased monsters into the level border (so he walked back into the town) | the fight kept its first target and measured progress by distance only | retarget when another monster is 3 tiles nearer, "in reach and swinging" counts as progress, monsters near a border are left alone | fd00fa43, 78ea6d51 |
| 15 | A script step `until:<line>` was satisfied by the same line from ten steps ago, or missed the line its own action logged | the log search had no notion of "since" | `LogMarkHost`: lines since the last step that did something (tests) | 13ff15f5, 78ea6d51 |
| 16 | Monsters ran at the hero's difficulty only through an environment variable | -- | superseded by the difficulty work merged from `fork/integration` (`v.difficulty()`); the merge kept its version | 0dd97de0 |

## Limits found, not fixed

* Items created in the game (loot, starting potions) are not written into the `.d2s` (the exporter never
  fabricates item bits: `d2hero/d2s_export.go`); they live in the `.od2` save only. A hero reloaded from the
  exported `.d2s` has the items of the file (9c compares `items=` before and after: both 0).
* Levels are rebuilt at every level change: a cleared Blood Moor is populated again when the hero returns, a
  dungeon forgets its dead monsters (the Den quest remembers it is done).
* Levels 13-16 and 37 (the second cave levels, the Tristram area) are not generated by the maze port yet
  (`OD2_AUTOLEVEL=13` falls back to the town), so the game cannot be played deeper than the first cave level.
  Act 2 and later are not built at all.
* A new Sorceress has no skill points and attacks with the staff; the real one starts with Fire Bolt
  (CharStats `StartSkill`, the rule that grants it is not looked up). The scripted hero casts Fire Bolt or the
  best attack spell he has points in (the level 94 sample throws Fire Ball).
* Outdoor tiles keep the approximation documented in `drlgoutdoor/doc.go`; the town preset's border towards
  Blood Moor is the first walkable border cell, the original blends the two presets. Where the town stamp
  ends the map is black (blocked), as is the rest of the level rectangle around the preset.
* Quill Rats and a few other AI classes are not ported (`AI not ported: stands still`): they never attack.
* Dungeon stairs resolve by the style rule in `TileDestination` (UNVERIFIED against the exe's table).
